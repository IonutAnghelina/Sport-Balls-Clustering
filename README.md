# Sport-Balls-Clustering

This repository contains the code used for Unsupervised Clustering for the Sports balls - multiclass image classification Dataset.

More information about the dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/sports-balls-multiclass-image-classification

The clustering techniques used are:

+ K-Means Algorithm
+ K-Medoids Algorithm
+ Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm

The feature extraction models used are:

+ Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
+ Vision Transformers (ViT)

A full documentation of the methods used is presented in the Anghelina_Ion-Marian_407_doc.pdf file
